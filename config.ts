    about: `As a self-taught developer, I've spent all of my spare time working on
    Javascript and React in the recent 3+ years. As a result of studying
    electronics during my high school period, it gave me a different
    perspective about how electronic devices work including computers
    in large amounts of detail, and that affected my developer journey
    tremendously. At the moment, I'm continuing to improve my tech
    skills every day while studying for my major.`,
